Aircraft: KC-46A Pegasus (Tail No. 12-004) 
Date/Time of Inspection: 17 NOV 2025, 18:30 Local 
Location: Hangar 5, Refueling Wing Maintenance Bay

Account of Findings:
The KC-46 (Tail No. 12-004) diverted back to home station following an in-flight refueling system malfunction and landed at approximately 17:45 Local. The aircrew reported a complete RVS failure requiring an Emergency Electronic Disconnect while engaged with a C-17.
Upon arrival, I was assigned to conduct the mandated post-emergency inspection of the refueling boom assembly prior to troubleshooting the RVS computational unit. The boom was visually inspected in the fully retracted and secured position.
Initial visual inspection showed no external scraping or major structural deformation on the flight surfaces of the boom. However, upon closer inspection of the boom nozzle assembly (specifically the main coupling piston and latch mechanism), I discovered the following damage:
1. Shear Pin Failure: The boom's primary hydraulic seal safety pin, located in the nozzle throat, was found fractured. This shear pin is designed to protect the coupling during extreme side-loading but is not expected to fail under a clean, controlled release. The failure indicates the disconnect sequence involved instantaneous, high-shearing force, consistent with the C-17's forward momentum immediately following the emergency latch release.
2. Latch Micro-Fracture: A hairline micro-fracture (approximately 3 mm in length) was detected using dye penetrant inspection on the internal surface of Latch Jaw A, immediately adjacent to the electronic release solenoid. This fracture likely resulted from the instantaneous pressure spike as the high-tension structural lock was electrically released.
The combination of RVS failure and the necessary emergency electronic disconnect procedure caused a structural anomaly in the nozzle assembly. The boom is currently red-tagged and secured. Repair will require replacement of the entire boom nozzle assembly, as the micro-fracture cannot be field-repaired and compromises the structural integrity of the high-pressure fuel coupling system. The aircraft is grounded pending replacement parts and a full systems test.
