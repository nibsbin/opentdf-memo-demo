Aircraft: C-17 Globemaster III (Tail No. 05-673, Callsign: Moose 67) 
Tanker: KC-46A Pegasus (Tail No. 12-004)
Date/Time: 17 NOV 2025, 14:15 Local 
Location: 85 NM West of San Diego, CA (Refueling Track 314)

Summary of Incident:
We were conducting a routine receiver mission as part of a KC-46 post-maintenance checkout flight. I was monitoring fuel state, aircraft systems, and maintaining communications with the tanker and ATC. Maj Fernando (Aircraft Commander) had established a textbook approach and was flying a rock-steady contact position.

At 14:10, the boom operator confirmed contact and we began receiving fuel. The transfer was proceeding normally—I was tracking our fuel quantity increase and cross-checking our position in the refueling envelope via the FLIR display.

At approximately 14:15, I heard the boom operator's emergency transmission: "Contact Broken, Blind!" The urgency in his voice was unmistakable. I immediately cross-checked our flight instruments and confirmed we were stable—autopilot engaged, altitude hold solid at FL250, airspeed locked at 270 KIAS.

Maj Fernando's immediate response was to freeze all control inputs. He directed me to maintain radio discipline and stand by for coordination from the tanker. I confirmed our autopilot status and began monitoring our closure rate and relative position to the tanker on the TCAS display.

The tanker Aircraft Commander, Maj Riley, came up on the air-to-air frequency and advised they had experienced a complete RVS failure with the boom locked in our receptacle. He requested we maintain absolute stability and prepare for an Emergency Electronic Disconnect. I acknowledged and confirmed our position was steady.

My primary focus became backing up Maj Fernando on aircraft stability. I called out any minor deviations in altitude or airspeed (there were none—Maj Fernando's flying was impeccable under pressure). When Maj Riley called "Disconnect in 3, 2, 1, Execute," I felt a slight jolt through the airframe as the boom released.

Maj Fernando immediately applied a slight forward thrust as briefed, and I watched the boom retract cleanly on the aft-facing camera. We were clear. I confirmed separation to the tanker and Maj Fernando executed a smooth departure from the refueling track.

Post-separation, I conducted a damage assessment using our available sensors and visual inspection capabilities. The receptacle appeared undamaged—no visible fuel leaks, no structural deformation visible on the aft camera. I relayed this to the tanker crew.

We terminated the mission and set course for home station. The coordination between our crew and the KC-46 crew was exceptional. What could have been a catastrophic mid-air incident was resolved cleanly through disciplined communication and steady airmanship.
