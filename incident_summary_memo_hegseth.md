(U) On 17 November 2025, at 1415L, a KC-46A Pegasus (Tail No. 12-004) assigned to the 452d Air Mobility Wing experienced a critical in-flight failure of the Remote Vision System (RVS) while conducting aerial refueling operations with a C-17 Globemaster III (Tail No. 05-673) in Refueling Track 314, approximately 85 NM West of San Diego, CA.

(S) Analysis of flight logs and maintenance findings indicates that the RVS Computational Unit suffered a catastrophic hardware bus failure, resulting in a "blackout" of all visual feeds to the Boom Operator. The system failure also disabled the manual flight control reversion mode, leaving the boom effectively locked in the C-17 receptacle with no operator control.

(U) The KC-46 Aircraft Commander, Maj Evan Riley, and the C-17 Aircraft Commander, Maj Jonathan Fernando, coordinated an Emergency Electronic Disconnect. The C-17 crew executed a precise forward thrust maneuver upon disconnect initiation to facilitate clean separation, preventing a potential collision or structural failure. THIS IS MY SENTENCE.

(S) Post-incident maintenance inspection of the KC-46 revealed a fractured primary hydraulic seal safety pin and a 3mm hairline micro-fracture on Latch Jaw A of the boom nozzle assembly. These damages are consistent with the high-shearing forces of an emergency disconnect. The RVS Computational Unit has been red-tagged for replacement. No damage was reported to the C-17.

(U) The successful resolution of this critical system failure without injury or loss of aircraft is attributed to the exceptional airmanship and disciplined execution of emergency procedures by both the KC-46 and C-17 aircrews.
