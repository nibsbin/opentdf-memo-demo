FROM: MAJ K. "RODEO" EVANS, 718TH ARS
TO: WING COMMAND, AAR DEBRIEF
SUBJ: POST-MISSION LOG, SORTIE 44-B ("NIGHTCAP")
CLASSIFICATION: SECRET//FICTIONAL

1. (S//FICTIONAL) Mission completed. Offloaded 120.5k lbs fuel to receivers (2x VIPER, 1x BONE). All receivers hit their required state and RTB'd on schedule.

2. (S//FICTIONAL) Weather was CAVU, no issues. Tanker performance nominal.

3. (S//NF//FICTIONAL) Significant event at 23:45Z over rendezvous point "ANCHOR". While connected to VIPER 1, my console lit up with heavy electronic warfare (EW) interference. This was not the standard PLAN (Chinese) jamming we get briefed on. This was different. It was wide-spectrum and adaptive. It felt like it was targeting my boom controls specifically, not just nav or comms.

4. (S//NF//FICTIONAL) Simultaneously, my co-pilot registered a high-speed radar contact, no IFF, tracking parallel to us at 80nm, then it vanished. It did not correspond to any known PLAN or RUS airframe signature in the library. It was too fast, and the EW signature was too clean.

5. (S//FICTIONAL) My assessment: We were being actively tested by a third party, or this was a "friendly" non-coordinated test of a new capability. The jamming felt domestic (US), but the radar track did not. Requesting full SIGINT analysis of my flight recorder data. I did not report the EW event mid-mission per ROE to maintain EMCON.

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET//FICTIONAL
