Aircraft: C-17 Globemaster III (Tail No. 05-673, Callsign: Moose 67) 
Tanker: KC-46A Pegasus (Tail No. 12-004)

Location: 85 NM West of San Diego, CA (Refueling Track 314)

Account of Incident:
We were executing a routine receiver role for a KC-46 maintenance checkout flight. I had established contact with the boom at 14:10, and we were in a steady state of fuel transfer at FL250. My position was stable in the contact envelope, centered and locked.
Approximately five minutes into the transfer, at 14:15, I felt an unusual, almost imperceptible surge in pressure against the receptacle. It wasn't an actual shift in the boom's position, but rather a momentary, stiff resistance—a feeling that the connection suddenly went from a firm mechanical lock to something rigidly bound. It was the kind of sensation that made me instinctively brace, wondering if the boom operator had inadvertently moved the boom or if my own station-keeping had wavered, though the flight controls were dead steady.
Before I could voice my concern to the co-pilot, we received a high-priority call over the air-to-air frequency from the KC-46 Boom Operator, TSgt Hayes: "Contact Broken, Blind!"
This communication instantly confirmed my intuition: something was seriously wrong. The call indicated a complete failure of the KC-46's Remote Vision System (RVS) while the boom was still mechanically engaged in my receptacle.
My immediate priority became maintaining a zero-movement, steady position. Any pilot-induced oscillation or drift at that moment could have caused the rigid, operator-less boom to shear or damage my receptacle, potentially leading to a fuel leak or an uncontrolled explosion. I directed my co-pilot to confirm all control inputs were minimized and focus solely on holding station.
The KC-46 Aircraft Commander, Maj Riley, quickly established coordination. He informed me that the boom's manual reversion system had also failed, leaving them with no means to actively control the boom or ensure a smooth, low-stress disconnect. He advised that they would be executing an Emergency Electronic Disconnect.
I prepared my aircraft for the separation. I maintained precise forward tension on the boom and advised Maj Riley that upon confirmation of the disconnect, I would apply a slight, controlled burst of thrust to help create immediate separation and pull the C-17 cleanly out of the zone.
The disconnect light in the receptacle illuminated, and simultaneously, I felt the familiar release of pressure, only this time it was preceded by a distinct, small jolt, which I associated with the emergency electronics successfully overriding the bound connection. I executed the forward thrust as planned. The separation was clean, with the boom safely pulling out of the receptacle and retracting swiftly.
Post-disconnect, we cleared the track to allow the KC-46 to secure their aircraft.
