(U) On 17 November 2025, a KC-46A Pegasus (Tail Number 12-004) experienced a catastrophic failure of its Remote Vision System (RVS) during an in-flight refueling operation with a C-17 Globemaster III (Tail Number 05-673, Callsign Moose 67) over the Pacific Ocean, approximately 85 nautical miles west of San Diego, California.

(U) The incident occurred at approximately 1415 local time during a routine post-maintenance checkout flight. The KC-46 had successfully established contact and transferred approximately 12,000 pounds of fuel when the RVS computational unit failed, resulting in a complete loss of boom control and visual feedback. The boom operator, TSgt Marcus Hayes, declared "Contact Broken Blind" and attempted manual reversion, which also failed due to a system lockup.

(U) Crew actions included maintaining aircraft stability, coordinating with the C-17 crew (Aircraft Commander Maj Jonathan Fernando, Co-Pilot Capt Sarah Chen), and executing an emergency electronic disconnect. The C-17 applied controlled forward thrust for clean separation. No injuries or damage to either aircraft occurred, and the mission was aborted with both aircraft returning to base safely.

(U) Preliminary maintenance inspection revealed failure of the RVS Computational Unit and minor damage to the boom nozzle assembly from the emergency disconnect. The KC-46 is currently grounded pending replacement of affected components.

(U) This incident highlights the criticality of robust backup systems in aerial refueling operations. Recommend expedited review of KC-46 RVS reliability and potential enhancements to manual control redundancies.
